        <h1>The DOM</h1>
    </header>
    <p>

The Document Object Model (DOM) is like a glue that holds all three JS (Javascript) HTML and CSS together.
 It binds all three languages together into a digital tree format. 
 Starting with Window, document and then moving down to folders and files of HTML CSS and JS the DOM tree has it all. 
 Being fully connected to all files and folders of all coding languages you have deployed in the webpage the DOM allows for flexible manipulation. For example, You can change an HTML element color, not through your JS. Why is that Impressive?
  For that, we have to start with HTML and CSS. HTML is the heart of your webpage.
  Without it, you couldn't write a word of text on your page.
   CSS is HTML’s makeup, it makes HTML look pretty when in reality it really isn’t. Through background colors, all the way up to little effects CSS makes your website presentable. 
   A simple analogy to describe the differences between the two is that HTML is a body and CSS is the clothing you wear on that body. Socks have no purpose without feet and gloves have no purpose without hands. CSS is like a glove without a hand without HTML.

    Javascript is different when in the DOM. JS has the power to manipulate almost all other files. But what does it do? JS follows a simple model called control flow. 
    In control flow, JS files are read from head to toe. Along this route though JS often encounters code that requires this flow to stop or change. 
    Loops are one of the most common causes of this flow to change. When a JS is being read and it comes across a loop and needs to carry out and fulfill the parameters of the loop before it can exit and continue on it regular flow path.
     It like waking up in the morning. You go and brush your teeth make yourself breakfast and so on. But what if you have run out of toothpaste or have no more spoons to have cereal with? That’s when your own control flow stops and a loop starts.
      You cant continue your morning routine until either you have brought new toothpaste or you have washed a spoon. For us, this might seem easy and we can be flexible and adjust but for a webpage, this loop is the be-all and end-all.
       If the loop does not get fulfilled the control flow and not continue and in a worse case, your browser will crash. Like loops functions also impede this process.
        Functions order the browser to carry out a set of tasks/actions if certain parameters are met. Its like waking up 30min, the parameter wake up late was meet so now our bodily function is saying to do everything at double the speed.

    Arrays and Objects. When I first started and still while I write these I still find them a little confusing. 
    Arrays are like data banks where you store information and objects, well objects are the same arent they? Kinda, Arrays are objects but only one type of object. That object is a list, Arrays are grocery lists, store inventory counts, student’s names on a class role and to-do lists. 
    All of which can be written on a piece of paper. Objects on the other hand are iPhones, chairs, doors, pencils, and bottles. So what’s the difference when it comes to coding.
    Both Arrays and Objects store information and therefore both need to be accessed quickly and easily. Arrays come with an advantage for this though. Each item in an array corresponds to a number.
     This number starts with 0 being the first time in the array and X for whatever the last item is.
      This makes arrays perfect to using in loops and functions as through iteration. Objects on the other hand don’t correspond to numbers and have to be identified with there name. This makes them less flexible but in my opinion easier to understand.
