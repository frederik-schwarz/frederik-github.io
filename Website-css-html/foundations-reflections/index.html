      <h3>What are three new things you learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
      <p> The first thing I learned about myself as a result of core learning is a love for problem-solving and feeling
         the reward of doing so. Another thing I learned about myself during core was my tendency to sometimes get 
         frustrated a little too quickly. Now I don't mean to throw a tantrum but definitely have some angry thoughts
         towards my computer and code. The last main thing I learned was my ability to solve problems and learn on my own.
         Before this course, i always considered myself a team learner/player, and through this last 5 week period I have
         come to learn that though that is correct I am most certainly able to learn and tackle problems just as well on my own.

    <h3>What Are the roles of Values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

    <p>
        Coding and learning can often get stressful and overwhelming.
         It’s during these times that we sometimes lose track of what we are doing both in the code and outside. 
         Values and self-awareness keep us steady in these stages.
         the values we have are sometimes the only things still keeping us from storming of from our desks or giving up for the day.
         They make sure and not so level heads stay level. Self-awareness also plays a huge role in this.
         Self-awareness lets you look at yourself and your actions from a third-person point of view.
         Without self-awareness, you wouldn't be able to catch yourself before saying something nasty or make a brash decision.
         Finally, empathy lets you stay connected with your and other’s emotions.
         Maybe not so much while working alone but when with others empathy is key to build a successful
         work relationship and solving problems.

    <h3>What surprised me the most about core learning? </h3>

    <p>
        The thing that surprised me the most about core learning is how JS is just a language.
        It does what it says it does. I thought coding / Js would be this mega problem that randomly
        generated your websites and would be incredibly hard to understand. However,
        I have come to learn that Its like speaking to someone with a very limited vocab. 


    </p>

    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of core learning? </h3>
    <p>
       
       The most challenging aspect of core learning, in my opinion,
       was the week 4 kata. I found the kata to be either super easy or extremely 
       difficult. 90% of the time I couldn’t solve the problems and I would turn to 
       the answers for help. I ended up learning to memorize the answer and less the step-by-step pieces of code.

    <h3>Why spend so much time on core? </h3>

    <p>
        The fundamentals are key. Even now 5 weeks into core it’s the basics that trip me up and not the crazy functions.
        It’s how to push to an array or even create an array that I still struggle with the most.
        Going into a nine-week camp you don’t want these issues to hold you back and that’s why it is key to have a 
        long period of preparation to make sure you will be able to complete boot camp to the best of your abilities. 

    </p>

    <h3>Did core feel like a waste of time?</h3> 
    <p>
        No, not at all. At the start of core, I was skeptical of how I would find the core and how worthwhile it would be.
        However now at the end and able to code basic little games I have been never happier with my coding ability.
        Coding can be scary and without learning fundamentals such as in core you would find it
        very hard to move forward not only in code my also mentally. You would be constantly in that I don’t 
        understand the mindset and that now where you want to be.
