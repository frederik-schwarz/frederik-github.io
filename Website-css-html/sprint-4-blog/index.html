      <h3>Rubber duck method</h3>
      <p> The rubber duck method is the process of explaining your problem to a rubber duck.
           This works because it allows us to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.
            When we explain a problem we need to give context and often while we are giving this context the solution will come to us.
      </p>

    <h3>Pseudocode:</h3>

    <p>
         Pseudocode is an extremely helpful planner tool to help you avoid errors and problems before they arise.
         The keys to pseudocode are single-line comments, descriptive comments with keywords such as IF and Loop.
         Pseudocode is something that I think can help me a lot and I should use. 

    </p>

    <h3>The simple problem I got stuck on: </h3>

    <p>
        While working through replit I got stuck on the built-in methods section.
         Built-in methods are pre-written pieces of code that you can access and use through a keyword. 
         These built-in methods come with a general structure. 
         The structure includes a function parameter and a follow-on event. It took me a long time to figure out this structure and understand how methods work.
         lso struggled with accessing these methods once I used them. How did I call them into action?
          The key to this process is naming the var that you have linked to it and follow this with the parameters in brackets. 

    </p>

    <h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way: </h3>
    <p>
        I didn’t solve any of the issues in an elegant way.
        Every single part of the methods and Olympics stumped me and caused me to check the answers after several hours of trying to figure them out.
        I attempted to problem-solving these issues through means of trial and error, taking two steps back and taking a break however it never worked.
        This frustrated me immensely.
        And on top of that, I felt the code implemented in the answers was also not very beginner-friendly and were methods that I would have never thought of.
        The riplit console is also horrible. 

    </p>

    <h3>What did I learn? </h3>

    <p>
        I learned to try and think outside of the box. 99% of the time I would approach a problem in a way that most made sense for me 
         (often simple for loop etc) but this didn’t work once.
         Instead, I still don’t understand when to implement a return statement and or declare a new variable instead. 
    </p>

    <h3>How do I feel about problem solving</h3> 
    <p>
        In all honesty, I forgot to use pseudocode once. For the rest of these techniques such as googling and reading errors, 
        i feel relatively confident however they (mainly google) just confused me more than I already was.
         Error messages were the most helpful.
