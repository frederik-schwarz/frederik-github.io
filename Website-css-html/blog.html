<p class="blog-para">I this Article I cover the differences between Inline and inline block. Booth are elements of the display property.
</p>
<p>Display: inline allows your element to move level with other inline elements on a page.</p>
<p>Display: inline-block lets you your element move level with other elements on you page.</p>
<p>So whats the difference? Inline and inline-block at first look a though they do the same thing. Move 
  into the same level as another element. However inline-block can do much more that that. When an 
  inline elemnet is placed into the structur of a page it does not even with the addtion of margin
  and padding effect the layout of the website.....

    <p class="blog-para">The Document Object Model (DOM) is like a glue that holds all three JS (Javascript) HTML and CSS together.
      It binds all three languages together into a digital tree format. 
      Starting with Window, document and then moving down to folders and files of HTML CSS and JS the DOM tree has it all. 
      Being fully connected to all files and folders of all coding languages you have deployed in the webpage the DOM allows for flexible manipulation....</p>

    <p class="blog-para">Understanding that the actions we take in our lives reflect on our brain’s ability to develop affects us greatly. When we come to learn that our brains are malleable and don’t have a set knowledge and ability that doesn’t change.
      We become more eager and open to try and learn more and new things. It eliminates this thought that you aren’t smart enough and that others were born smarter. Instead, you come to realize that you are also capable of learning and achieving. </p>

        Pseudocode is an extremely helpful planner tool to help you avoid errors and problems before they arise.
         The keys to pseudocode are single-line comments,
          descriptive comments with keywords such as IF and Loop. Pseudocode is something that I think can help me a lot and I should use.

         The first thing I learned about myself as a result of core learning is
         a love for problem-solving and feeling the reward of doing so. Another thing I 
         learned about myself during core was my tendency to sometimes get frustrated a 
         little too quickly. Now I don't mean to throw a tantrum but definitely have some angry 
         thoughts towards my computer and code. The last main thing I learned was my ability to solve problems and learn on my own.

      My long-term goal is to find a job related to full-stack javascript development after I complete my EDA course.
      The skills I want to acquire in order to make this a reality is a good foundation’s knowledge of full-stack JS.
      A foundation that I can build on while I search for work.
