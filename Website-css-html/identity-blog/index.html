<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Who am I? I am an opinionated person who loves to debate, is open to new ideas/ opinions, a critical thinker, happy, friendly, humorous, filled with energy and I have a big will to improve. These were the first things I wrote down when I asked myself who I was. Growing up in a german household, often yields a similar outcome, strong minded, opinionated and not afraid for a big debate. Often comments we receive in public are “what are you guys arguing about?” when in actual fact we're passionately discussing the latest political speech or global event.  Now this doesn't mean I'm aggressive or short tempered but rather most of these discussions are shared with a big grin and a laugh or two. It takes some people a bit of time to warm up to this; for instance my kiwi girlfriend. Who has now coined the term “german arguing” which she would define as “a very passionate debate about current events or opinions which can be intimidating when you first take part but you eventually grow to love.” This is the side of me that loves critical thinking and opening my mind to new ideas while expressing my own ideas. When you first meet me this isn't the side you'll be greeted with, but instead the more humorous and friendly me. Before i began this course i worked as front of house at a local wellington restaurant which included chatting- a lot of chatting. Through doing this job full time i discovered a love for customer service and bringing a smile to people's faces. My boss often called me the charmer as I would return from serving a table with the biggest grin on my face. And frequently leaving a table with smiles on their faces too. This to me is extremely gratifying as I loved the human interaction. 
    However like with every job it wasn’t as straightforward as that. In hospitality thinking on the fly is everything. Whether that's what to say to a customer or deciding what task is most important of the three you are juggling. Resistance and tension can become all too common if you don’t adapt to matters. On my first few shifts I caused myself many headaches by not clearing tables, leaving customers waiting and forgetting orders deu to not adapting fast enough. Little by little though I came to understand that this ability to adapt was the key and after months and months of developing it I can happily say it's now a key strength of mine which I will always be able to call on. Another thing I learnt and my boss pointed out to me once was that I am a stubborn learner. I am my own biggest critic so criticism from others can sometimes be taken with a pinch of salt. It's a weakness however that I am in the process of and will forever be in the process of changing and trying to improve. The ability to crack jokes and adapt on the fly is something I am extremely excited to bring to the EDA team working environment and for those skills that I am yet to fully develop I'm excited to do so.
    
    My will to improve is something I've always had but has advanced greatly within the last six months. In September of 2020 I took the leap and moved to Germany to pursue tertiary study. Unsurprisingly, covid flipped this plan drastically. Germany was unexpectedly heading into its second wave very quickly. Meanwhile I had freshly arrived and was readily trying to adapt to my new life. As a few months passed and cases continued to worsen I took the advice of my parents, and my gut, and returned back to New Zealand where I knew I would be safe. This trip taught me how volatile and uncertain life can be. I've always been hungry to succeed but returning to New Zealand only elevated this hunger because of what I'd left behind- my chance at my dream degree. I no longer had a direction for my education. This hunger to find a new path led me to coding. I taught myself some basics and realised I wanted to pursue it. This is how I ended up here.
