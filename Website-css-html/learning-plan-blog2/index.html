      <h3>What are my biggest strengths and limitations for Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p> 
        I think my biggest strength for Bootcamp will be resilience and people skills.
         I think my biggest weakness will be my ability to stay engaged during tasks I don’t find as enjoyable.


    <h3>My biggest non-technical challenge?    </h3>

    <p>
        Preparing myself / portfolio for a job interview. (I don’t like writing)

    </p>

    <h3>What team skills would I like to see developed? </h3>

    <p>
        I would like to see myself becoming an active voiced member in a problem-solving environment.
        And further down the line even a leader. 
    </p>

    <h3>What are my expectations of a Bootcamp team? </h3>
    <p>
        My expectations of the Bootcamp team are to be open to hearing questions/ideas and help solve these without judgment. 

    </p>

    <h3>What are the expectations for myself at Bootcamp?    </h3>

    <p>
        I expect myself to try my very best and not shy away from any tasks.
        I don’t tend to shy away but in a new stressful environment I expect myself to keep this attitude.
        I also expect myself to stick at problems and not throw in the towel after a few attempts. 
        Challenge myself and be open to the idea of getting stuck. On a social level, 
        I expect myself to treat everyone with respect and be open to helping others if I can. 

    </p>
