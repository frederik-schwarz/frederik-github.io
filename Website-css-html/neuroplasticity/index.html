        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
    </header>
  
      <h3>How does understanding Neuroplasticity benefit us? </h3>
      <p>Understanding that the actions we take in our lives reflect on our brain’s ability to develop affects us greatly. When we come to learn that our brains are malleable and don’t have a set knowledge and ability that doesn’t change.
         We become more eager and open to try and learn more and new things. It eliminates this thought that you aren’t smart enough and that others were born smarter. Instead, you come to realize that you are also capable of learning and achieving. 
    </p>

    <h3>How will I engage with neuroplasticity to better myself?
    </h3>

    <p>Having now learned that I like everyone else am capable of learning and growing my brain. 
        I appreciate hard work and dedication more. I have gotten more comfortable with the idea of putting long hours into a topic in order to better myself. 
        Understanding why I must sit and repeat an action over and over has always been an annoyance to me. I mean is it even proven to work? Yes and that is what I now know through the research on neuroplasticity. 
    </p>

    <h3>How can we increase Neuroplasticity? 
    </h3>

    <p>
        Neuroplasticity can be improved surprisingly easily. In the modern age, we often spend our past time melting our brains in front of screens. One of the easiest things we can do to enhance our neuroplasticity is to engage our brains even during periods of relaxation.
         Whether that’s reading a crime novel, finding love for sowing, or even just trying to step outside our comfort zone. Its the process of building small habits that not only create new pathways but also strengthen these paths that allow us to build on our all-around neurologic ability.

    <h3>What is a growth mindset?</h3>
    <p>A growth mindset is how we react to challenges. Someone with a growth mindset tends to take criticism as constructive feedback, not take the easy way out, and sees failure as part of the learning process.
         This is key as the opposite is the fixed mindset which restricts your ability to grow mentally and physically in every sense of the word. Having a growth mindset is key to your ability to learn new skills and take on challenges.
          It’s this mindset that will get you through times of hardship and struggle while learning.

    <h3>My research and surprises.
    </h3>

    <p>What surprised me the most while researching this topic is how easy it is to change/manipulate this mindset. 
        In an experiment carried out by Carlo Dweck a small “not yet” test result instead of a “fail” inspired kids to continue trying and being attentive in school. 
        Its this idea that you cant pass which is portrayed in the word “fail” which unknowingly leads kids to have a fixed mindset of not being good enough. 
        That this one change in word can cause such an impact in the way we think gives me hope that fixed mindsets are if approached correctly easy to break down and build back up as growth mindsets.
