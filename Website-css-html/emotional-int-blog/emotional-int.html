            <h3>What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
<p>Emotional intelligence is your ability to understand your emotion and also that of those around you. It is also the ability to use that intelligence in your actions / reactions.
</p>

<h3>How is it different from IQ?</h3>
<p>Emotional intelligence is different from IQ in the sense that it is able to be changed and worked on. IQ does not have any effect on your ability to work with people and or how to act in specific moments such as moments of high stress. IQ and EQ have no relation, there are separate unrelated metrics. IQ does not tend to change over time. 
</p>
<h3>Why is it important?</h3> 
<p>EQ is arguably more important than IQ. EQ is key to being able to work with and manage a group of people. EQ can open doors that you never thought possible. Even in everyday relationships out of a workplace high EQ will allow you to have diplomatic conversations rather than unnecessary arguments. EQ lets you be calm under pressure.
