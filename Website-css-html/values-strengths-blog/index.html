     <h1>My Learning plan</h1>   
    <h3>What is my long term goal and or career pathway: 
    </h3>
            
<p>My long-term goal after I complete EDA is to find a job in the tech sector and develop myself both technically and physically with this job. It’s something I’m extremely excited about and can’t way to start. 
</p>

<h3>Strengths and limitations for learning: 
</h3>
<p>My key strength for learning is my eagerness to do so. I love the idea of learning and developing my ability of JS. When I leave EDA I want to continue developing and learning. Another key strength of mine for learning is my discipline. Discipline comes easiest to me when I’m interested and intrigued by a subject. So for 90% of what I am learning, I don’t find it difficult to get out of bed and get straight into coding. This though also brings me onto one of my limitations. For sections of the course that I don’t find interesting such as the writing sections such as this one, I find it difficult to keep discipline. I am often able to overcome this by looking ahead and getting excited about the next content. But this is still a limitation to keep an eye on. Another limitation that I find myself sometimes having is my overeagerness to learn sometimes causes me to rush through tasks. It’s a limitation that stops me from being able to soak up information to the best of my ability. 
</p>

<h3>What core skills would I like to develop?
</h3> 
<p>I look forward to developing my ability to work with a team under pressure. I find stress and pressures cause many of us to act and behave in ways we never thought we would. It’s extremely difficult to see a light at the end of the tunnel sometimes in these moments. So I am keen and excited to build my pressure handling skills when I am with others at EDA

</p>

<h3>Workload:
</h3> 
<p>When I am working with others or myself I always try to hold myself to the highest standards (not just technically). It’s through a constant and consistent work plan that I will be able to do this even in the most stressful periods. Small things like setting myself daily goals (Often with regard to total hours worked) and sticking to these goals I will be able to manage my social and technical ability. 
    When times get stressful I will need to stick to this constant structure the most. Set goals, times and give me a break. And through these three tasks ill be able to deliver a great experience for myself and those I meet at EDA
    </p>

<h3>
    Where to find help:
    </h3> 
<p>For technical issues, my facilitator and other students will always be my first points of reference. However, for more mental things I will try to use my support system at home. If this does not seem to help my situation I won’t hesitate to seek help from EDA (facilitator and students).  

    </p>

<h3>What do I expect from the facilitator team?
</h3> 
<p>For me, the most important thing is an open mind. The willingness to explain and go through an issue if thats code or mental. My second most important is availability and to be there for us students when we need help whether that’s on slack or in person. </p>

<h3>Scheduling:
</h3> 
<p>My most important scheduling item is to start early. I work best early in the day and start to 
    struggle in the early evening / late afternoon. Therefore an early start anywhere between 7 and 9:30 is key.
