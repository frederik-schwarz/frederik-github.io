    <H1>Inline and inline-block</H1>
    <p>Display: inline allows your element to move level with other inline elements on a page.</p>
<p>Display: inline-block lets you your element move level with other elements on you page.</p>
<p>So whats the difference? Inline and inline-block at first look they look as though they do the same thing. Move 
  into the same level as another element. However inline-block can do much more that that. When an 
  inline elemnet is placed into the structur it does not even effect the structure. Now what if you add padding and margin? still nothing, the only way to effect the structure of a webiste with inline block is through the use of its Font-size.
  Changing the font-size on an inline block isnt very practical however as it is not meant for menipulating 
  entire layouts. The below image shows the idea of inline and inline-block a little better. The image is a block element and 
  there for it will never be on the same line as the text above.
