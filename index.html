    <h4>Inline and inline-block</h4>
    <p>
      Display: inline allows your element to move level with other inline elements on a page.
      </p>
<p>Display: inline-block lets your element move level with other elements on your page.
</p>
<p>
  So what is the difference? Inline and inline-block at first look they look as though they do the same thing. Move into the same level as another element. However, inline-block can do much more than that. When an inline element is placed into the structure it does not even affect the structure. Now, what if you add padding and margin? still nothing, the only way to affect the structure of a website with inline-block is through the use of its Font-size.
   Changing the font size on an inline-block isn’t very practical however as it is not meant for manipulating entire layouts. The below image shows the idea of inline and inline-block a little better. The image is a block element and
   therefor it will never be on the same line as the text above.

  <p>Inline-block affords you more options than inline but should be used carefully. For texts like this, it would be silly to use inline-block as it would give me the opportunity to disrupt my text. Inline and Inline-block are great beginner safety nets. They don’t let you edit your website till it breaks but instead, they force you to make a conscious decision on first changing to display inline-block and then changing margins from there. However, if you decide inline-block is what you need then it is a great tool. It can be extremely frustrating trying to move elements around on the page. Too often they will end up stacking or not letting you put a margin or padding and you sat there feeling hopeless and frustrated. This is where inline-block comes and saves the day. Inline-block lets you not only align-items next to one another but also change how far apart they sit. It lets you manipulate this through the CSS rules margin and padding. Disabled for inline these are enabled for inline-block.
    If used well inline-block has the power to transform your website!
